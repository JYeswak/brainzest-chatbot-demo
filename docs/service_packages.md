# BrainZest Service Packages

This document outlines our initial, pre-packaged service offerings. The goal is to provide clear, value-driven options for small businesses that solve specific, high-pain problems.

## Pricing Philosophy: Value-Based Pricing

Our prices are not based on hours worked; they are based on the value and cost savings we provide to your business. Our goal is to charge between **10-40%** of the estimated monthly cost of the labor and services we are automating or replacing. This ensures you see a significant return on your investment from day one. Final pricing is determined after a complimentary "AI Opportunity Audit."
