# Client Onboarding Process

This document outlines the automated and manual steps for onboarding a new client, from initial contact to project kickoff. The goal is to create a seamless, professional, and high-touch experience that showcases the power of our automation.

## Phase 1: Initial Inquiry & Automated Qualification

*   **Trigger:** A potential client interacts with the BrainZest website.
*   **Channel:** AI-powered Chat & Voice Agent.

*   **Step 1: Engagement & Information Gathering**
    *   The AI agent greets the visitor and offers help.
    *   It's programmed to answer FAQs, describe services, and guide the conversation.
    *   **Goal:** To understand the visitor's needs and determine if they are a potential client.
    *   **Key Questions:** "What are the biggest time-wasting tasks in your business right now?", "Are you in the WISP or Construction industry?"

*   **Step 2: Lead Qualification & Data Capture**
    *   If the visitor expresses interest in a solution, the AI agent initiates the lead capture process.
    *   **Script:** "It sounds like we can definitely help with that. I can have a BrainZest specialist follow up with you. What is the best name, email, and phone number to reach you at?"
    *   The agent collects the information and saves it.

*   **Step 3: Instant Automated Follow-up**
    *   **To BrainZest:** An instant push notification and email is sent to you with the lead's details and a transcript of the conversation. The subject will be: "New Qualified Lead: [Client Name]".
    *   **To The Lead:** An automated email is sent immediately.
        *   **Subject:** "Thanks for chatting with BrainZest!"
        *   **Body:** "Hi [Client Name], thanks for your interest. Your information has been passed along to our team of Zesters, and we'll be in touch shortly. In the meantime, here is a [Free Gift - e.g., 'Top 5 AI Prompts for Business Owners' PDF] as a thank you for chatting with us."

## Phase 2: Project Scoping & Sign-up

*   **Trigger:** You (the founder) review the qualified lead information.

*   **Step 4: Human Triage & Status Update**
    *   You review the lead. In your internal system (e.g., a Trello board or Notion), you move the lead from "New" to "In Progress".
    *   **Automation:** Changing this status triggers a second email to the client.
        *   **Subject:** "Your BrainZest project is underway!"
        *   **Body:** "Hi [Client Name], good news! The team has started reviewing your request. To ensure we build the perfect solution for you, let's schedule a brief 15-minute scope call. Please pick a time that works for you here: [Link to Calendly]."

*   **Step 5: The Scope Call**
    *   You meet with the potential client to confirm their needs, discuss the value proposition, and recommend a service package.

*   **Step 6: Proposal & Payment**
    *   After the call, you send a follow-up email with a link to a checkout page (e.g., Stripe, SamCart).
    *   **Email Text:** "It was great speaking with you! As discussed, here is the link to get started with the [Service Package Name]. Once payment is complete, you'll get instant access to your private client portal."

## Phase 3: Project Kickoff

*   **Trigger:** The client completes the payment.

*   **Step 7: Automated Portal & File System Access**
    *   **Automation:** Successful payment triggers the final onboarding workflow.
    *   An email is sent with:
        *   A welcome message.
        *   A link to their private, secure client folder (e.g., a shared Google Drive or Dropbox folder).
        *   Instructions on what initial documents to upload (if any).
        *   A link to book their official "Project Kickoff" call.

*   **Step 8: Automated Reporting & Communication**
    *   The client is automatically enrolled in a weekly or monthly progress report email.
    *   The system is now set up to allow them to book a chat with you via a dedicated calendar link at any time.
