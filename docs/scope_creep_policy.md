# Scope Creep Policy & Procedure

## 1. Philosophy

Our goal is to be a flexible and responsive partner to our clients. However, to deliver results effectively and on budget, we must adhere to the agreed-upon scope of work for each service package. This policy is not designed to be rigid, but to provide a clear and fair process for handling requests that fall outside of that scope.

Our motto for scope creep is: **"That's a great idea! Let's scope it."** We treat new ideas as opportunities, not interruptions.

## 2. Identifying Scope Creep

A client request falls outside the initial scope if it involves:

*   **New Deliverables:** Requesting a new feature, report, or piece of content not explicitly listed in the signed Service Agreement (Exhibit A).
*   **Significant Platform Changes:** Requesting to migrate a solution from one platform to another (e.g., moving a chatbot from Tidio to a custom-built solution).
*   **Additional Support or Training:** Requesting extensive training sessions or support for systems not deployed by BrainZest.
*   **Increased Volume:** A significant and sustained increase in usage that requires a higher tier of a third-party service (e.g., a chatbot that grows from 100 conversations a month to 10,000).

## 3. The Procedure

When a client makes a request that appears to be out of scope, follow these steps:

1.  **Acknowledge and Validate:** Immediately acknowledge the request and validate the idea.
    *   **Script:** *"That's a great idea for improving the system. I can see how that would be valuable."*

2.  **Clarify the Scope:** Gently but clearly frame it as a new piece of work.
    *   **Script:** *"What you're describing is a bit outside the scope of our current [Service Package Name] agreement. I'd be happy to explore what it would take to build that for you."*

3.  **Propose a Scoping Project:** Offer to treat the new request as a mini-project.
    *   **Script:** *"I can put together a quick 'Project Proposal' for this. It will outline the deliverables, timeline, and a one-time project fee. If you'd like to proceed, I can send that over for your review. How does that sound?"*

4.  **Create the Proposal:** If they agree, create a simple, one-page proposal that includes:
    *   **Project Goal:** What the new feature will do.
    *   **Deliverables:** What will be created.
    *   **Timeline:** How long it will take.
    *   **Price:** A fixed, one-time fee for the project.

5.  **Execute:** If the client approves the proposal, execute the work as a separate project, outside the recurring service agreement.

## 4. Updating the Service Agreement

If a client consistently requests new features, it may be a sign that they have outgrown their current service package. This is an opportunity to upsell them to a higher tier or a custom retainer.

*   **Script:** *"I've noticed that you're having a lot of great ideas for expanding the system. It seems like your needs are growing, which is fantastic. It might be time to consider moving up to our [Next Tier Package], which includes [X, Y, Z additional features], or we could design a custom retainer that gives you a set number of 'development hours' each month for new projects like this."*
