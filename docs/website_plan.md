# BrainZest: Website Blueprint

This document outlines the structure, content, and goals for the `brainzest.ai` website. The primary objective is to clearly communicate our unique value proposition and guide visitors from our two primary niches into the right funnel.

## 1. Overall Strategy & Tone

*   **Core Message:** "Stop wasting time on repetitive tasks. We build AI engines to make your business run itself."
*   **Tone:** Professional, direct, and results-oriented. Avoid jargon. Focus on benefits (time saved, money earned), not features (AI, automation).
*   **Key Goal:** Get the visitor to identify with a problem and book a free "AI Opportunity Audit" call.
