# KPI and Reporting Strategy

This document defines the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for each service package. The goal is to quantify the value delivered to the client, providing concrete data for monthly reports and powerful case studies.

## Guiding Principle: From Features to Financials

Our reporting should always connect our services (the features) to the client's bottom line (the financials). Instead of saying "The chatbot had 100 conversations," we say "The chatbot handled 100 inquiries, saving an estimated 8 hours of staff time this month."

## Tier 1: The "Time Saver" Starter Pack

*   **Core Value Proposition:** We save you time and capture leads you would have missed.

    3.  **Estimated Time Saved (Hours):** This is a calculated metric. We'll establish a baseline with the client (e.g., "An average inquiry takes me 5 minutes to handle").
        *   **Formula:** `(Inquiries Handled by AI) * (Avg. Time Per Inquiry in Minutes) / 60`
