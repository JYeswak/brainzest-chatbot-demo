# Repeatable Sales Process

This document outlines a simple, repeatable sales process for engaging potential clients on industry forums (like WISP Talk) and other online communities. The goal is to build authority and trust by being helpful, not by being "salesy."

## The "Helpful Expert" Funnel

This process is designed to be executed in short bursts (e.g., 30 minutes, 3 times a week).

### Step 1: Identify Pain Points (The "Listening" Phase)

*   **Action:** Spend 10 minutes scanning relevant forums, Facebook groups, or LinkedIn discussions.
*   **Goal:** Find a thread where someone is expressing a clear business pain that you can solve. Look for keywords like:
    *   "Wasting so much time on..."
    *   "Can't keep up with..."
    *   "How do you guys handle..."
    *   "Is there a tool for..."
    *   "Struggling to..."

### Step 2: Provide Genuine, Public Value

*   **Action:** Write a helpful, public response to the thread. **Do not mention your business or services.**
*   **Goal:** To be seen as a helpful expert by the original poster and everyone else reading the thread.
*   **Good Response Example:**
    *   *"That's a common struggle. Many businesses solve this by using a simple automation workflow. For example, you can connect a web form directly to your accounting software using a tool like Zapier or n8n. When a client fills out the form, it automatically creates a draft invoice. It can save a few hours a week."*
*   **Bad Response Example:**
    *   *"My company BrainZest can solve this for you! Check us out at brainzest.ai."* (This will get you ignored or banned).

### Step 3: The Private Message (The "Offer")

*   **Action:** A few hours after your public post, send a direct, private message to the original poster.
*   **Goal:** To make a direct connection and offer a next step.
*   **Script:**
    *   *"Hi [Name], I'm the person who replied to your post about [the pain point] earlier today. It's a problem I'm really passionate about solving."*
    *   *"I've actually built a few automated solutions for this exact issue. If you're interested, I'd be happy to show you how one of them works on a quick 15-minute call next week. No sales pitch, just a demo of what's possible."*
    *   *"If that sounds helpful, you can grab a time on my calendar here: [Link to your Calendly]"*

### Step 4: The Demo Call

*   **Action:** The potential client books a call.
*   **Goal:** To run them through your "AI Opportunity Audit" (as defined in the `client_onboarding_process.md`) and guide them to the appropriate service package. This is where you transition from "helpful expert" to "consultant."

## Tracking

*   Use a simple spreadsheet or a free CRM tool to track the people you've contacted.
*   Columns: `Name`, `Forum`, `Pain Point`, `Date of Public Post`, `Date of PM`, `Status` (e.g., Responded, Booked Call, Became Client).
